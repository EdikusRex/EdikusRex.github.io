const aboutSPR = `Swanton Pacific Ranch (SPR) is a 3200-acre/ satellite property of Cal Poly’s 
                  off Highway 1, ~60 miles south of San Francisco. It was donated in 
                  1993 by Al Smith a Cal Poly alum, as a “living laboratory fostering LBD.”  
                  The Ranch’s landscape is composed of redwood forests, riverine ecosystems, 
                  and coastal grasslands. Sharing the rich history and research opportunities 
                  of SPR has always been a problem with the lack of signage off HWY1 and with 
                  the year-round staff not usually available to field questions. So, a plan was 
                  devised to provide access to this information through an interactive, remotely 
                  updated, creative outreach tool for researchers and the public, requiring no 
                  mediation...and Poppy was born!`
